About edX Courses and Programs
*******************************

EdX offers both individual courses and groups of related courses, called
programs.

To learn about a course, select the course in the `edX course catalog`_ and
review its About page. The About page provides information including a course
description, the institution that offers the course, the hours of work that
you should expect to spend on the course each week, and the enrollment
options, or tracks, that the course offers.

=========================
Course Enrollment Options
=========================

When you enroll in an edX course, you select either the audit or verified
enrollment track, depending on whether you want to earn a verified certificate
for your course.

About the Audit Track
**********************

Most courses offer an audit track. The audit track does not include a
certificate when you complete your course. The audit track is free of charge,
and includes access to all course materials, including assignments and exams.
You are automatically enrolled in the audit track when you enroll in a course.

After you enroll in the audit track, if the course offers a verified track and
the deadline for enrolling in the verified track has not passed, you can
upgrade to the verified track. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Change to
the Verified Track`.

.. _SFD Verified Track:

About the Verified Track
************************

Many courses offer a verified track in addition to the audit track. The
verified track awards :ref:`verified certificates<SFD Verified Certificates>`
to learners who submit payment, :ref:`verify their identities<SFD Verify Your
Identity>` using a webcam and a government-issued photo ID, and pass the
course.

If a course has a verified track, you see a "Verified" indication on the
course image in the course catalog on edx.org.

To :ref:`enroll in the verified track<SFD Change to the Verified Track>` for a
course, you pay a fee that varies by course. The fee helps support edX's
mission. The amount of the fee is listed on the About page for that course. If
you are unable to pay the certificate fee, you can apply for financial
assistance using the `financial assistance application`_.

.. note::   When you enroll in the verified track, you do not have to verify
   your identity immediately. However, you must verify your identity before
   the deadline for verified enrollment in that course. For more information,
   see :ref:`SFD Verify Your Identity`.

For more information about enrolling in the verified track for a course, see
:ref:`SFD Enroll in a Course` or :ref:`SFD Change to the Verified Track`.

For a list of all courses that currently offer verified certificates, see the
`edX course catalog`_.

For more information about certificates, see :ref:`Certificates` and `Verified
Certificates`_ on the edx.org website.

Programs

In addition to taking individual edX courses, you can enroll in an XSeries
program or MicroMasters program.

An XSeries program is a group of courses that explore a specific subject in
depth. An XSeries program offers an XSeries certificate after you earn a
verified certificate for all of the courses in the program. All courses in an
XSeries program offer verified certificates.

XSeries programs have an "XSeries program" indication in the course catalog on
edx.org. To learn more about the program and its courses, select the program.

To complete an XSeries program, you must earn a verified certificate in each of
the courses in the program.

For more information about XSeries programs, see `XSeries Programs`_ on
edx.org.

MicroMasters programs are a series of graduate level courses that you take for
credit in a specific career field. After you earn a MicroMasters certificate,
you can apply to a university that offers credit for those MicroMasters courses.
If you are accepted, you can then apply your MicroMasters credit toward a
masterâ€™s degree at that university.

MicroMasters programs have a "MicroMasters" indication in the course catalog on
edx.org. To learn more about the program and its courses, select the program.
