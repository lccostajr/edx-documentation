Accessing Course Content
##########################

When you begin a course, select the **Course** page to see the structure of
the course. From this page, you can select and jump to that part of the course
content. If you have previously accessed or worked in the course, select
**Resume Course** to jump to the part of the course that you last accessed.

Be aware that in some courses, not all of the the course content is available
at the beginning of the course. Instead, additional content might become
available as you work, either because it was scheduled for release on a
specific date, or because you completed required content that allowed you to
proceed to further content.

* In some courses, the course team schedules the dates on which the sections of
  the course content are available to you. On the date that the course team
  chooses, the course content appears in the course navigation pane.

* Course teams might make course content unavailable at certain points in the
  course. For example, after an assignment's due date has passed, or after the
  end date of a self-paced course, the assignment might no longer be
  available.

* Some courses include content that has prerequisite sections. Prerequisite
  sections require that you complete other, previous sections before they
  become available. The course team sets a minimum score that you must earn in
  the problems of a prerequisite section in order to display the following
  sections.

Not all courses include scheduled course content or prerequisites. Your course
might display all of the course content in the course navigation pane as soon
as you begin taking it.

If you do not see the course content that you expect, you can check for
information about the course schedule and content prerequisites on the course
**Home** page or course discussions.
