If you are new to online learning or massive, open, online courses (MOOCs), you
might want to take the `edX Demo course`_. EdX provides this demonstration
course to give you a way to explore and learn how to take an edX course. Read
about :ref:`learning in a MOOC<Learning in a MOOC>`.


.. _Time Zones:

************************
A Note about Time Zones
************************

The dates and times that new materials are released, and when homework
assignments and exams are due, are shown throughout your course.

In your account settings, you can select your local time zone so that any
course dates and times are displayed in your local time.

.. Important::
   If you do not select a time zone in your account settings, edX lists dates
   and times on your dashboard, in the body of the course, and on your
   **Progress** page in the time zone that your browser settings specify. Other
   times and dates appear in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Dates and times
   that use your browser time zone are in military time and are followed by a
   time zone indicator: for example, 17:00 Sept 16, 2018 IOT. Dates and times
   in UTC do not have a time zone indicator.

   To convert UTC time to your local time, you can use any time zone converter
   that you want, including one of the following time zone converters.
