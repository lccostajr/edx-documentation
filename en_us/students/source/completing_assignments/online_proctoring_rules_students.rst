Online Proctoring Rules for Learners
####################################

This topic describes the proctoring rules for learners taking an edX course
for credit.

.. note:: The proctoring rules listed in this topic are the basic rules that
   most courses use for "closed book" exam situations. If a particular exam in
   your course has different rules, such as allowing you to access reference
   material or use a calculator or pen and paper during the exam, your course
   team will let you know. The rules that your course team announce to you are
   the rules that will be used to judge your exam.

   If you are not told that your exam has different proctoring exam rules,
   make sure that you follow the "Closed Book Exam" rules that are described
   in the following sections.

******************************
Overview of Online Proctoring
******************************

EdX.org uses an online proctoring service to provide monitoring for certain
exams. Learners who take proctored exams are required to adhere to a set of
defined rules to receive a **Satisfactory** result from the proctoring
service.

The proctoring rules listed in this topic are the basic rules that most
courses use for "closed book" exam situations. Your course team might decide
on different rules for a proctored exam in your course, such as allowing you
to access reference material or use a calculator during the exam.

Learners are responsible for testing their systems with the proctoring software
well in advance of all online proctored exams in their courses, so that any
troubleshooting that is required can be accomplished. Some courses include
practice proctored exams, so that learners can experience an example proctored
exam, including the software download and system check steps.

As with other ID-verified assessments and exams, learners will be asked to
establish their identity during the proctored exam process by supplying a
government-issued photo ID with a full name that matches the name they used to
register on edX.org.

.. note:: If you require additional time or any specific accommodations or
   exemptions to the exam policies in order to complete a proctored exam,
   contact your instructor or edX Support.

To pass a proctored exam, learners must make sure that the environment in
which they take the exam meets the following requirements.

   enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred.
   If overhead lighting is not available, the source of light should not be
   behind you.

#. Sit at a clean desk or table, not on a bed or couch.

#. Clear the desk or table of all materials such as books, papers, notebooks,
   calculators, and so on, unless you have been specifically permitted (in
   posted guidelines) to have such materials available for a particular
   examination.

   In addition to pens, paper, calculators, textbooks, and notebooks, the
   following tools should not be on your desk or used during your proctored
   exam.
