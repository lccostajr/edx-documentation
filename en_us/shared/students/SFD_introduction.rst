At edX, we are glad to welcome new learners to the `edx.org`_ website or to

course, earning certificates, participating in course discussions, and
completing some of the exercises you may see in your course.

*********************************
Introducing edx.org and edX Edge
*********************************

EdX hosts courses on the `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_ websites.

* The edx.org website has massive open online courses (MOOCs) that are designed
  and led by edX partner organizations. This website lists all available
  courses publicly, and learners from around the world can find and enroll in
  these courses. When we refer to "edX" accounts and courses we are referring
  to accounts and courses on edx.org.

* EdX Edge has small private online courses (SPOCs), which are usually created
  for use on campus or within an organization. These courses often have
  limited enrollment and are not listed publicly. To enroll in a course on
  Edge, you must receive an email message with an invitation to enroll and the
  course URL from the course team. You do not need to create an account on
  Edge unless you have received an invitation to enroll in an Edge course.
  Courses on Edge do not offer certificates.

.. note::  While edX hosts both of these websites, the user accounts for
   edx.org and edX Edge are separate. If you take courses on both sites, you
   must complete the :ref:`account registration <Register on edX>` process
   separately for each site.


.. _Learning in a MOOC:

******************
Learning in a MOOC
******************

A massive, open, online course (MOOC) typically uses videos and text to present
course content, although you might also encounter other types of reading
assignments, such as textbooks and online articles. A MOOC also includes
assessments, in the form of practice questions, homework assignments, and
exams. To help you share information, ask questions, and collaborate with other
learners and the course team, course discussions are available.

Videos and other types of course content, assessments, and discussions are used
in virtually every MOOC on the edx.org website. These course components are
also used to create the courses on websites that use the Open edX online
learning platform. Everyone is welcome to review examples of these components,
and practice using them, by enrolling in the `edX Demo course`_.

In some courses, enhanced components might also be included, from team
problem-solving exercises and lab work to live demonstrations and ask me
anything (AMA) sessions. Every course has a unique design, and course teams
are continuously looking for new ways to engage learners and teach more
effectively. Course teams typically include instructions for how to use any
enhanced components right in the course.

MOOCs bring learners from all over the world together. The people who you take
a course with have a wide variety of educational backgrounds and educational
goals. One part of the MOOC experience that everyone shares is encountering new
ways of learning. As a result, most learners occasionally have questions about
what is expected, how to complete an assignment, or what a word, phrase, or
abbreviation means.

********************************************
If You Have Questions As You Take a Course
********************************************

If you have a question about something you encounter in an edX course, try
these options for getting an answer.

* Check the **Home** page. Course teams use this page to post updates about the
  course, which can include explanations about course content, reminders about
  when graded assignments are due, or announcements for upcoming events or
  milestones.

* Look for an "Introduction", "Overview", or "Welcome" section on the
  **Course** page. Course teams often include general information about how the
  course works and what you can expect, and also what they expect from you, in
  the first section in the course.

* Participate in the :ref:`course discussions<Explore Posts>`. If you encounter
  an unfamiliar word, phrase, or abbreviation, such as "finger exercise" or
  "board work", search for it on the **Discussion** page, or post a question
  about it yourself. Other learners might be able to answer your question, or
  might have the same question themselves. Your comments and questions give the
  course team useful feedback for improving the course.

* Investigate other resources. Within the course, a :ref:`wiki<SFD Wiki>`, if
  one is available, can be a good source of information. Outside of the course,
  a course-specific Facebook page or Twitter feed might be available for
  learners to share information.
