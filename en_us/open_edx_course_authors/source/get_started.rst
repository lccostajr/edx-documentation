.. _What is Studio?:

***************
What Is Studio?
***************

Studio is the edX tool you use to build your courses.

You use Studio to create a course structure, and then add problems, videos, and
other resources for learners.

With Studio, you can also manage the course schedule, identify members of the
course team, set the grading policy, publish your course, and more.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional
software.

****************
What Is the LMS?
****************

The LMS is the web-based tool where you view the courses you have created in
Studio.

If you have not created a course, see :ref:`Creating a New Course`.

#. In Studio, locate your course on your dashboard and open your course.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, select **View
   Live**.

   Your course enrollment page opens in a new browser tab.

#. Select **Enroll** to enroll in your course. After you enroll in your course,
   it opens in the edx.org LMS.

#. To continue working on your course, return the browser tab that shows
   Studio.
